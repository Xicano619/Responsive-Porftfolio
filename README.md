# Responsive-Portfolio
##### OVERVIEW
The focus of this project was centered around creating a professional portfolio using Boostrap grids and CSS. Three files were created: About me file, contact file and portfolio file, linked together. 

# AboutMe Page
This file is completely designed using BootStrap grids: navbar, main, and footer. This file's content proliferates who I am.
